// the literals are those values which can be assigned.
// pre-defined values that can be assigned. this is called reserved literals
// that is boolean values can be set to true otherwise false.
// string literals example : string s = "NCCS" ;

// seperator , the most commonly used seperator is ; and it is used to terminate
// a statement

// if we want to use int as an object we use a wrapper of int i.e INTEGER
// we cannot assign null to the preemptive
// we can only assign null to object and wrapper class, reference variables.
// example int n = null;

// max(int , sizeofa , sizeofb) are the format in which the output gets print
// out
// b = b+1

// java only works on true or false not 0 or 1 like other languages such as C or
// C++.

// char
// char ko 1 byte bhaneko 8 bits bhayesi range is from 0 to 256.
// but char in java has 2 bytes from the start.
// 1 byte holds the data other byte holds the unicode.
// and since it is 2 byte so the range is from 2^16.
// 0 - 65535 range gets supported by a unicode i.e UTF 8
// we have three reserved literals i.e true, false and null for example String s
// = null;
// null is where we can insert the values , empty is where data is removed.
// garbage collector (GC) is used for destroying object and setting objects to
// null.

// DEFAULT VALUE
// byte b; declaration

// the value is assigned by the jvm automatically

// string s = "null";
//tama on declaration

//3 types of variable -> instance , static , local 
//variable declared outside the methods and defined in the class is called instance variable
//int a; converting this into static by static int a; //same as above but with static keyword
//local variable are those which are declared inside a method

//integral literals are of 4 types such as hexadecimal , decimal , octal and binary
//int a = 10; is the integral literals and this is the decimal format
//int a = 0x10 ; this is the hexadecimal format , 0b10 for binary format ,0 only for octal format



//all objects gets placed in heap memory 
//there are 3 types of variable they are: static, instance and local 
//variable gets created in a stack
